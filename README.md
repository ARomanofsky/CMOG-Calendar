CMOG-Calendar
=============

CMOG Calendar, Orthordox Church Calendar 

Still a work in progress, it is now being tested at ChurchMortherOfGog.org for all its calendar pages.

This is an attempt to take the concept and data from a Joomla Mod I wrote, and make a Wordpress plugin for a Calendar based on the Orthodox Church Year.   It relies on templates to build event entries.
