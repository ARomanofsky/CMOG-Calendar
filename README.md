CMOG-Calendar
=============

CMOG Calendar, Orthordox Church Calendar 

Still a work in progress, it is now being tested for a rewrite of https://churchmotherofgod.org/church-calendar/monthly-calendar.html, and https://churchmotherofgod.org/church-calendar/daily-evets.html for all its calendar pages.

This is an attempt to take the concept and data from a Joomla Mod I wrote, and make a Wordpress plugin for a Calendar based on the Orthodox Church Year.   It relies on templates to build event entries, and offsets from Pascha.
